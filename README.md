senaite.monkeypatches
=====================

This is an add-on that provides monkey patches to override/customize existing senaite.core and other plone add-on package `api`s at runtime. 

Features
--------

- This add-on uses the collective.monkeypatches package to override/customize SENAITE functionality.


Examples
--------

This add-on can be seen in action in the following contained scripts/files; [validators.py](src/senaite/monkeypatches/validators/validators.py) together with [configure.zcml](src/senaite/monkeypatches/validators/configure.zcml), [__init__.py](src/senaite/monkeypatches/content/__init__.py).

Function calls are patched using the monkeypatches package as can be seen in the `configure.zcml` file, where as variables/constants are patched within the `__init__.py` file. The patches are conventionally organised in packages named relative/simillarly to package names of their existing unpatched methods and/or variables.

All packages required at runtime are registered in the root [configure.zcml](src/senaite/monkeypatches/configure.zcml) file.

For details on how the patches are applied please refer to the following [collective.monkeypatcher](https://github.com/plone/collective.monkeypatcher/blob/master/README.rst) documentation.

List of all packaged patches
----------------------------

* `bika.lims.content.abstractbaseanalysis.ResultOptions` replacement with a different variable/config that allows for greater field `maxlength` and `size` of the `ResultValue` field for the `ResultOptions` widget.
* `bika.lims.content.abstractbaseanalysis.schema` updation with the new `ResultOptions` config.
* `bika.lims.validators.ResultOptionsValueValidator.__call__()` replacement with a validator function that allows for non-numeric result option values.
* `senaite.core.browser.frontpage.frontpage.FrontPageView` Changes the way senaite handles authentication. By default it will always redirect to the login page for using username/password. This changes this behaviour so it uses the first available auth plugin which by default is the session plugin (username/password). This then allows us to install a custom plugin and make it the first available plugin replacing the session plugin.



Installation
------------

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
